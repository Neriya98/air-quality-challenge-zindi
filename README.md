This project focuses on estimating PM2.5 levels in eight African cities using satellite observations and machine learning techniques based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Ground-based data will validate these estimates. Deployed via AirQo's platform, this initiative aims to empower communities with vital air quality information for tackling local pollution, improving public health, and advancing environmental justice.

I just wanted to share my preprocessing tasks. Perhaps it will help someone that want to do samething. 

Here I used some package to run some queries about meteo informations and also get some informations about capital of countries in the datasets. 
I didn't have time to focus on the challenge. But I reached 12.94 as best score in the leaderboard.
